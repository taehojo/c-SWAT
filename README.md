# c-SWAT: Circular-Sliding Window Association Test 

## Overview

The circular-Sliding Window Association Test (c-SWAT) is a novel deep learning approach that considers correlations between features, utilizing modules such as WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) to enhance classification prediction performance.

### Execution Examples

For wgcna module:
```bash
python c-SWAT.py data/ADNI_norm.csv data/wgcna.txt
```

For classes module:
```bash
python c-SWAT.py data/ADNI_norm.csv data/classes.txt
```
